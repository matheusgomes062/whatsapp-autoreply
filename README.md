# whatsapp-autoreply



## Description

A personal project I made with the intention to automate my responses in what's app. In that way, I can work without being distracted.



## How to run

To run this project you need to download chromewedriver, here's the link to download it, choose your system and version!

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Then you need to run the project with python, in this case, you need to install python and selenium to make it work.

For now at least.

Don't forget to alter the path of the webdriver file in the code and the user and message you want to send!

After running you need to wait for the QR code to appear and scan it. I made the program wait 60 seconds for you to scan it.

Now just wait the magic happens.



## Next stages



I divided the project into the following stages.



1.  ~~Make something that accesses wpp, even if it isn't pretty. In short, I need to figure out how to operate with selenium.~~

2. Make something that replies.

3. Make it reply to certain phrases or words.

4. Use/make some API to analyze the phrases and reply accordingly.

5. Make it run as a backward process.

6. Make a chrome extension.
