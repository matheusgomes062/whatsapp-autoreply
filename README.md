# whatsapp-autoreply

A personal project I made with the intention to automate my responses in what's app. In that way, I can work without being distracted.


I divided the project into stages.

1.  ~~Make something that accesses wpp, even if it isn't pretty. In short, I need to figure out how to operate with selenium.~~
2. Make something that replies.
3. Make it reply to certain phrases or words.
4. Use/make some API to analyze the phrases and reply accordingly.
5. Make it run as a backward process.
6. Make a chrome extension.

You can help me create this project by submitting your pull requests!
